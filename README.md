This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Hi There. My name is Rahul Krishnan and I am a software engineer with a background in finance. I love getting people with different skillsets together to produce unique web experiences that would not otherwise happen.

This portfolio website is itself a small demonstration in React, with clen organization of assets and a focus on component reusability.
